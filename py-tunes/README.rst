py_tunes
========

py_tunes provides access to the iTunes music library and application.

Indexing
--------
Since the iTunesLibrary framework requires a code signed application or executable,
py_tunes does not access it directly. Instead, it reads from a SQLite database
generated by `an Objective-C program`_. Running this program
from Python causes issues with OS X's entitlements system, so it is distributed
and run separately.
